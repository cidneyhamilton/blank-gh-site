This is the first time I've updated my website in two years. 

I'm trying something different. Clean, simple, minimalistic.

I've been making websites since 1999, when I was an angsty preteen who wore a lot of black. I went to school, got a degree in computer science, and started getting job titles like "Software Engineer" to do this in the real world. 

The Internet, and I, grew up at the same time. Now, we're adults. 

I haven't written anything longform on my website for a while. I'll see how it goes.
