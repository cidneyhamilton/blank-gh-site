**Mel Martin** is the Democrat running for Florida's Senate [District 14](https://www.flsenate.gov/Senators/S14). This district represents northern **Brevard County** and southern **Volusia County**, from Port Orange to Viera.

She is running first and foremost as an **environmentalis**. The district she'll represent contains much of the **Indian River Lagoon**, one of the most significant estuaries in North America. Her district alone contains Mosquito Lagoon, the Merritt Island National Refuge, and the Canaveral National Seashore. 

The Indian River Lagoon is home to thousands of unique species of plants, animals, and birds. It's a breeding ground for **dolphins** and **manatees**, and vital to the **regional ecosystem**. However, in recent decades, its health has been in crisis due to human impact on the environment.

Martin grew up in Central Florida. After retiring from the **Marine Corps**, she moved back to Brevard County to raise her family, where it became evident that the waterways she grew up with are in jeopardy. She previously served as president of the [Brevard Indian River Coalition](https://helpthelagoon.org/), but the change that needs to happen needs to happen in Tallahasee.

The Indian River Lagoon is not just for plants and animals; it's also **vital to Florida's economy**; driving 10% of Florida's **tourism revenue**. Tourists come here to kayak and spot rare birds. Rick Scott, the current governor of Florida, is a climate change denier whose platform of expanding business by decreasing regulations has hindered rather than helped the economy. 

The 2018 general election in Florida is on **Tuesday, November 6th**. Early voting begins on **October 27th**.
