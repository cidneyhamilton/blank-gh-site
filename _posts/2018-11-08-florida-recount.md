Eleciton day was **Tuesday, November 6th, 2018**. As of Thursday, **three** races in Florida are too close to call and likely to be recounted.

[Nikki Fried](https://nikkifried.com/), the Democrat running for Commissioner of Agriculture, was slightly behind on election day. As more ballots were counted, she gained a 500-vote lead over her opponent.

Senator [Bill Nelson](https://www.nelsonforsenate.com/) and Mayor [Andrew Gillum](https://thanks.andrewgillum.com/) are still behind their opponents, but only by a small margin. This is enough to automatically trigger a recount by Florida law.

Nelson and Gillum were both comfortably ahead in the polls prior to Election Day, but as results came in, they trailed slightly behind their Republican challengers. **Palm Beach** and **Broward County** are still counting vote-by-mail and provisional ballots; and in every county, there are provisional ballots that have not been counted.

By Florida law, a recount is automatically triggered if the winner only has a 0.5% lead. A manual recount is triggered if the difference is 0.25%. The 2018 is reminiscent of the 2000 Presidential Election, where Al Gore would likely have won had it not been for a Supreme Court order to halt a partial recount.
