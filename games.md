## Adventure Games

Here are some narrative-driven games I've worked on:

### Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption

Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption is an fantasy roleplaying game telling the story of Shawn O'Connor, a would-be thief who gets sent to reform school at the Hero University in order to become a rogue. Development by Transolar Games was funded on Kickstarter and the game will be released in June 2018.

### The Owl Consults

Once you've established yourself as the ruler of the crime world (and, eventually, the literal world), the only challenge left is helping out the next generation of supervillains---for a suitable fee, of course. A text adventure written with Thomas Mack and Nick Mathewson for IFComp 2017.
