I'm a software engineer with a specialty in UX. I make games and websites.

I'm Central Florida native who moved to Massachusetts for college. In my spare time I've written LARPs, volunteered for conventions, and performed in a circus troupe.

## Games I've Made

* A minimalistic [Space Invaders](http://cidneyhamilton.com/space-invaders/)
* A minimalistic [Tic-Tac-Toe](http://cidneyhamilton.com/tic-tac-toe/)
* [The Owl Consults](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=32u49mceyst7p8ey), with Thomas Mack and Nick Monfort, for IFComp 2017
* Some really embarrassing student work from college.
* Lots of other things, that I made in high school, before I remembered to keep backups.
