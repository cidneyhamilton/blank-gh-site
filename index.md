## About Me

Hi, I'm Cidney.

I write code and design things for a living. I'm one of those weird design/developer hybrid types. I make websites, games, and other interactive things.

I've been freelancing for four years, and have never looked back. I've worked with Transolar Games to make <a href="http://hero-u.net/forum/">Hero-U Rogue to Redemption</a>, and also do volunteer work with the local <a href="http://brevarddems.org">Democratic Party</a>.

## Contact

To get in touch with me, sending me a <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@cidney">toot on Mastodon</a> or an <a class="u-email" rel="me" href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email</a> is best. I'm also active on the <a href="http://hero-u.net/forum/">Hero-U forums</a>. I'm generally open to inquiries about working together or meeting up if you're visiting the Space Coast.

I'm on <a rel="me" href="https://www.facebook.com/cidney.hamilton">Facebook</a>, but am not too comfortable posting personal information there, so this is not the place to contact me.
