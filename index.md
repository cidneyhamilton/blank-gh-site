## About Me

I’m a software engineer with a specialty in UX. I make games and websites. My game development porfolio is [here](/games).

I’m Central Florida native who moved to Massachusetts for college. In my spare time I’ve written LARPs, volunteered for conventions, and performed as a circus contortionist.
