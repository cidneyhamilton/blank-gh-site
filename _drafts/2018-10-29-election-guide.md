The US midterm elections take place **Tuesday, November 6, 2018**. This is my guide to voting in Brevard County, Florida. 

*If youâ€™re not registered to vote in Florida, none of this will apply.* Most of the candidates and all of the elections are statewide, so the guide partially covers all races in Florida.

Florida allows early voting and voting by mail. Out of 13 million registered voters, 2.6 million have already voted.
